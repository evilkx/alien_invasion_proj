- The first commit 2020-2-10 21:40 
  ### What we do?
  - Create three py files, including alien_invasion.py, ship.py, setting.py.
  - Make a project including above files and an images floder containing a cute ship's bmp file.
  ### What can we do?
  - Actually, nothing can we do, but a ship shown on the center-bottom screen.
  - But today is the first day right? It will be fine.
